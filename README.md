# member-database

Our member database application

## Design Choices
- keep it simple
- keep it maintainable
- proven technologies > fancy stuff
- use things that we know

therefore we want to use
- poetry (dependency management, packaging, virtualenv)
- sqlite or postgresql (database)
- django
- vue.js for the interface(s)
  - if possible CDNs, avoiding webpack et. al
